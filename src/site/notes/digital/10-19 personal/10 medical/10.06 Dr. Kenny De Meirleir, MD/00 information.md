[Information on CTM Associates](message:%3C1473687397.256001.1683911603569@webmail-oxcs.networksolutionsemail.com%3E)

Good afternoon Brandon, 
 
It was great talking to you today. I added a few files that I will describe:
 
1) PowerPoint presentation I found form Dr. De Meirlier discussing ME-CFS.
 
2,3) Gift of Health Grant I mentioned. 
 
4) June appointments as well as some general info about the clinic. 
 
Here are the websites associated with CTM Associates:
 
- https://www.wpi.ngo/
-  https://www.ctmassociates.co/
 
The WPI is the "host" of the clinic and provides the space for the clinic to run. You might find more information on this website.
