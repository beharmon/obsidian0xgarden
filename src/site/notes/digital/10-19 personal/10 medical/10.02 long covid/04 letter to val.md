## LETTER

Request for Workplace Accommodations

Dear Dr. Leitko,

I am writing to request workplace accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). As you are my treating physician, I would appreciate your assistance in this matter.

As you may be aware, I have an on-going disability that affects my ability to perform certain job tasks. I believe that with reasonable accommodations, I can perform the essential functions of my job more effectively. Specifically, I am requesting the following accommodations:

I am requesting a continuance to be able to work from home as I attempt to find resolution to my situation.
-or-
If working from home is not an option, I am requesting an individual office space that allows me to control the environment and eliminate visual and audio distractions. 

Either accommodations will also limit my contact and exposure to possible reinfection which could worsen my already fragile state.

I believe that these accommodations are reasonable and necessary to allow me to perform my job duties to the best of my ability. I am willing to provide additional information or documentation as needed to support my request. Below is additional information I have been journaling in my experience after long a covid infection and some information about my work place. There are also a few questions..

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let me know if you require any additional information or if you have any questions regarding my request.

Sincerely,
Brandon

**My work information:**

I have worked for the State of Nevada since 2009. 11 months ago I changed jobs to work at the Department of Health and Human services in Sparks.
I am IT Professional II supporting record systems. The last 11 months I have been working from home 3 days a week. I have no issues meeting performance standards or meeting deadlines, but it takes 100% of my energy and leaves no room for life thereafter. Providing income to support my family is what life has been reduced to over the last 1.5 years. Working at home I am able to control the temperature, lighting, sounds and eliminate distraction. 

The plan of the State is to bring everyone back July 1st. The office I have been assigned to contains 4 employees with no barriers that I don't work with, who engage in remote meetings all day., large open windows and I happen to sit under the air exchange that blows cold air all day. This accelerates the drain I feel and  I am less efficient.

My current health condition, all external factors that I cant minimize or control, cumulatively accelerate my energy drain on the %30 energy receive from sleep. Some assistance finding a quiet place will help me address my symptoms. Unfortunately the leadership is not on-site and seem unaccessible to informally ask for some accommodation to heal and recover. I am also waiting until after June 1st as I fear that if I ask for help during probation period they may deny and fire me.


**Question seeking guidance:**

After 1.5 years of no positive changes in my health after covid infection, I have decided to accept I may not get better and I may have a disability. 

Most my symptoms mirror ME/CFS. How do I proceed? Should I be consulting doctors like Dr. Kenny De Meirleir who specialize in ME/CFS and long covid?

Do Doctors like yourself, diagnose diseases like ME/CFS? If no, how do you recommend I proceed?
Can you and I request accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) without some sort of diagnosis?

Please give patient a 5 mL syringe
Dissolve one tab 50 mg in 50 mL of water
This give 1 mg/mL (so it doesn't matter whether we talk about mg or mL)
Keep refrigerated; shelf-life is several month
Use a syringe to measure dose Start 0.5 mL (i.e., 0.5 mg) at bedtime
Increase dose every 2 weeks by 0.5 mg until 4.5 mg
If you develop vivid dreams or insomnia, take in the morning instead





The dosage they get you to start with 1mg and work your way up to 4.5. You should stop at whatever dose you feel best.

You can also prescribe at 50mg to bypass the cost and constant script changes. 

Below are the instructions for managing a 50mg dose:

Dissolve one tab 50 mg in 50 mL of water
This give 1 mg/mL (so it doesn't matter whether we talk about mg or mL)
Keep refrigerated; shelf-life is several month
Use a syringe to measure dose Start 0.5 mL (i.e., 0.5 mg) at bedtime
Increase dose every 2 weeks by 0.5 mg until 4.5 mg
If you develop vivid dreams or insomnia, take in the morning instead

If you are open to this method I have all the syringes and measuring tools to manage this process.

Let me know. thank you! LDN seems to be the most effective for some patients and I am looking forward to giving it a try.
