April 23rd 2023 --Submitted request to Valerie Valerie Leitko, PA-C
April 25rd 2023 --dr. responded. didnt answer questions ---called 






My question help me understand which path I will be taking.

I am green when it comes to undersate the term Diagnosis. 

As far as I know I have been not been diagnoed. me requesting acomdations really based on my research mean this request is somwhat inforval vs a validated diagnosis.

This kind of determines if this is a forma ADA request vs an informal request. Both seem to have different weights. 

Are you diagnosing me or do I have to find a method to be diagnosed?


ADA seems very specific. So I dont want to go in requesting ADA if I dont even have a diagnosis.
