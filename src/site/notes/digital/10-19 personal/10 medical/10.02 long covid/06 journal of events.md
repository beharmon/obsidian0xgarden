April 23rd 2023 --Submitted request to Valerie Valerie Leitko, PA-C
April 25rd 2023 --dr. responded. didnt answer questions ---called 
April 28rd 2023 --dr. still no response
May 3rd  called again-- spoke formulated a plan for the 9th



I submitted some questions on April 23rd that would help me try to get to a comfortable place to continue to work.
You didn't answer the questions so i'm guess you didn't read the entire email.

As far as I know I have been not been diagnoed. me requesting acomdations really based on my research mean this request is somwhat inforval vs a validated diagnosis.

This kind of determines if this is a forma ADA request vs an informal request. Both seem to have different weights. 

Are you diagnosing me or do I have to find a method to be diagnosed?


ADA seems very specific. So I dont want to go in requesting ADA if I dont even have a diagnosis.
